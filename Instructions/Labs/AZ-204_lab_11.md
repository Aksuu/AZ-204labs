# Lab 11: Monitor services that are deployed to Azure

## Microsoft Azure user interface

Given the dynamic nature of Microsoft cloud tools, you might experience Azure UI changes that occur after the development of this training content. As a result, the lab instructions and lab steps might not align correctly.

Microsoft updates this training course when the community alerts us to needed changes. However, cloud updates occur frequently, so you might encounter UI changes before this training content updates. **If this occurs, adapt to the changes, and then work through them in the labs as needed.**

## Instructions

### Before you start

#### Sign in to the lab environment

Sign in to your Windows 10 virtual machine (VM) by using the following credentials:

- Username: `Admin`
- Password: `Pa55w.rd`

> **Note**: Your instructor will provide instructions to connect to the virtual lab environment.

#### Review the installed applications

Find the taskbar on your Windows 10 desktop. The taskbar contains the icons for the applications that you'll use in this lab, including:
    
-   Microsoft Edge
-   File Explorer
-   Visual Studio Code
-   Azure PowerShell

## Lab Scenario

In this lab, you will create an Application Insights resource in Azure that will be used to monitor and log application insight data for later review. The API will be set to automatically scale if demand increases to a certain threshold and logging the data will help determine how the service is being utilized.

    ```

1. Run the following command to import version 2.20.0 of **Microsoft.Extensions.Logging.ApplicationInsights** from NuGet to the current project:

    ```
    dotnet add package Microsoft.Extensions.Logging.ApplicationInsights --version 2.20.0
    ```

    > **Note**: The **dotnet add package** command will add the **Microsoft.ApplicationInsights** package from NuGet. For more information, refer to [Microsoft.Extensions.Logging.ApplicationInsights](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Extensions.Logging.ApplicationInsights).

1. In the **Visual Studio Code** window, in the **Explorer** pane, navigate to the **Controllers** folder, and then open the file **WeatherForecastController.cs**.

1. Review the content of the file and note that it includes a constructor injection for the generic ILogger<WeatherForecastController> interface.

    ```csharp
    using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc;
    namespace SimpleApi.Controllers;
    [ApiController]
    [Route("[controller]")]
    public class WeatherForecastController : ControllerBase
    {
        private static readonly string[] Summaries = new[]
        {
            "Freezing", "Bracing", "Chilly", "Cool", "Mild", "Warm", "Balmy", "Hot", "Sweltering", "Scorching"
        };
        private readonly ILogger<WeatherForecastController> _logger;
        public WeatherForecastController(ILogger<WeatherForecastController> logger)
        {
            _logger = logger;
        }
        [HttpGet(Name = "GetWeatherForecast")]
        public IEnumerable<WeatherForecast> Get()
        {
            return Enumerable.Range(1, 5).Select(index => new WeatherForecast
            {
                Date = DateTime.Now.AddDays(index),
                TemperatureC = Random.Shared.Next(-20, 55),
                Summary = Summaries[Random.Shared.Next(Summaries.Length)]
            })
            .ToArray();
        }
    }
    ```

    > **Note**: You'll leverage this configuration to implement custom logging. Currently, the constructor displays a group of five randomly generated weather forecasts. You'll modify the controller to display one forecast at a time. For each forecast, you'll generate an informational, warning, or error log entry indicating the type of weather (mild, severe, and extreme). After these log entries are recorded by Application Insights in the corresponding Log Analytics workspace, each entry will have an automatically assigned severity level of 1, 2, or 3. 

1. Replace the definition of the `public IEnumerable<WeatherForecast> Get()` method in the file **WeatherForecastController.cs** with the following content:

    ```csharp
        {
            var rng = new Random();            
            int temperatureC = rng.Next(-20, 55);
            var summaryId = rng.Next(Summaries.Length);
            switch (summaryId)
            {
                case 0: case 9:
                _logger.LogError("WeatherForecast: extreme weather");
                break;
                case 1: case 2: case 7: case 8:
                _logger.LogWarning("WeatherForecast: severe weather");
                break;
                default:
                _logger.LogInformation("WeatherForecast: mild weather");
                break;
            }
            return Enumerable.Range(1, 1).Select(index => new WeatherForecast
            {
                Date = DateTime.Now.AddDays(index),
                TemperatureC = temperatureC,
                Summary = Summaries[summaryId]
            })
            .ToArray();
        }
    ```

1. Save and close the file.

1. At the terminal prompt, run the following command to build the .NET Web API:

    ```
    dotnet build
    ```

#### Task 2: Test logging of a .NET Core API app

1. Run the following command to launch the .NET Web API.

    ```
    dotnet run
    ```

    > **Note**: Keep the web API running and monitor the output of the Visual Studio Code **terminal** pane as you perform the next steps in this task.

1. Review the output of the command and note the HTTPS URL that the site is listening on.

1. From the taskbar, open the context menu for the **Microsoft Edge** icon, and then open a new browser window.

    > **Note**: Position the browser window such that it doesn't block the Visual Studio Code **terminal** pane.

1. In the browser window that opens, navigate to the URL you identified and add the **/weatherforecast** relative path of your web API  and then refresh the page several times.
    
    > **Note**: The full URL is `https://localhost:[port-number]/weatherforecast`, where the `[port-number]` placeholder identifies the port number at which the web app is accessible via the HTTPS protocol.

    > **Note**: Each time you refresh the page, it should display a different weather forecast in the following format.

    ```
    [{"date":"2021-09-04T14:35:29.0789168-07:00","temperatureC":2,"temperatureF":35,"summary":"Sweltering"}]
    ```

    > **Note**: Each refresh of the page should result in an informational, warning, or error message display at the terminal prompt, in the following format:

    ```
    warn: SimpleApi.Controllers.WeatherForecastController[0]
      WeatherForecast: severe weather
    ```

    > **Note**: Refresh the page several times to ensure that you generated at least one message of each type (**info**, **warn**, and **fail**).

1. Leave the API app running.

#### Task 3: Review the Application Insights logging

1. On your lab computer, switch to the **Microsoft Edge** browser window displaying the Azure portal.

1. In the Azure portal, navigate back to the blade of the **instrm**_[yourname]_ Application Insights resource you created previously in this lab.

1. On the **Application Insights** blade, in the **Monitoring** section, select **Logs**.

1. If needed, close the **Welcome to Log Analytics** pane and **Queries** pane.

1. In the **New Query** pane, type the following query and select **Run**:

    ```
    traces
    | order by timestamp desc
    ```

1. Review the results of the query.

    > **Note**: The results should include log entries corresponding to the warning and error messages generated by the .NET Core api app, with their respective severity levels (2 and 3).

    > **Note**: It can take up to five minutes to observe requests in the Application Insights metrics charts.

    The following screenshot displays the log query results on the **Application Insights Logs** blade.

       ![Log query results on the Application Insights Logs blade](./media/l11_web_api_insights_logs.png)

    > **Note**: You could deploy the updated API app to an Azure web app to collect its logs using Application Insights in an equivalent manner.

    > **Note**: You can extend the Application Insights logging level to include informational events by modifying the **appsettings.Development.json** (or **appsettings.json**) file as illustrated in the following code listing. However, you should keep in mind that this will considerably increase the log volume, which has potential network performance and pricing implications:

    ```
    {
      "Logging": {
        "LogLevel": {
          "Default": "Information",
          "Microsoft": "Warning",
          "Microsoft.Hosting.Lifetime": "Information"
        },
        "ApplicationInsights": {
          "LogLevel": {
            "Microsoft": "Information"
          }
        }
      }
    }
    ```

1. Close the browser window displaying the output of your API app.

1. Switch to the **Visual Studio Code** window, and then select **Kill Terminal** (the **Recycle Bin** icon) to close the **terminal** pane and any associated processes.

#### Review

In this exercise, you configured and tested Application Insights logging of your web API app.
