# Lab 02: Implement task processing logic by using Azure Functions

## Microsoft Azure user interface

Given the dynamic nature of Microsoft cloud tools, you might experience Azure UI changes that occur after the development of this training content. As a result, the lab instructions and lab steps might not align correctly.

Microsoft updates this training course when the community alerts us to needed changes. However, cloud updates occur frequently, so you might encounter UI changes before this training content updates. **If this occurs, adapt to the changes, and then work through them in the labs as needed.**

## Instructions

### Before you start

#### Sign in to the lab environment

Sign in to your Windows 10 virtual machine (VM) by using the following credentials:

- Username: `Admin`
- Password: `Pa55w.rd`

> **Note**: Your instructor will provide instructions to connect to the virtual lab environment.

#### Review the installed applications

Find the taskbar on your Windows 10 desktop. The taskbar contains the icons for the applications that you'll use in this lab, including:

- Microsoft Edge
- File Explorer
- Windows Terminal
- Visual Studio Code

## Lab Scenario

In this lab, you will demonstrate the ability to create a simple Azure function that echoes text that is entered and sent to the function by using HTTP POST commands. This will illustrate how the function can be triggered over HTTP. 

Additionally, you will demonstrate how to execute an Azure function by setting it to execute on a fixed schedule. The function will write a message to a log each time the schedule is triggered.

Finally, you will demonstrate how an Azure function can connect to other Azure resources, such as a storage account. The function will connect to a storage account that you create and return the contents of a file that is stored in the Azure storage account.

    /*The following lines of code to add using directives for the 
    Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc, Microsoft.Azure.WebJobs, 
    Microsoft.AspNetCore.Http, and Microsoft.Extensions.Logging namespaces.*/
    public static class Echo
    {/*The following code block to create a new public static method 
    named Run that returns a variable of type IActionResult and that 
    also takes in variables of type HttpRequest and ILogger as parameters
    named request and logger.*/
        [FunctionName("Echo")]
        public static IActionResult Run(        
            [HttpTrigger("POST")] HttpRequest request,
            ILogger logger)
        {
            logger.LogInformation("Received a request");
            return new OkObjectResult(request.Body);

1. In the **Microsoft Edge** browser window, enter the name and password of the Microsoft or Azure Active Directory account you are using in this lab, and then select **Sign in**.
1. Return to the currently open **Windows Terminal** window. Wait for the sign-in process to finish.
1. From the command prompt, run the following command to publish the function app project (replace the `<function-app-name>` placeholder with the name of the function app you created earlier in this lab):

    ```powershell
    func azure functionapp publish <function-app-name>
    ```

    > **Note**: For example, if your **Function App name** is **funclogicstudent**, your command would be ``func azure functionapp publish funclogicstudent``. You can review the documentation to [publish the local function app project][azure-functions-core-tools-publish-azure] using the **Azure Functions Core Tools**.

1. Wait for the deployment to finalize before you move forward with the lab.
1. Close the currently running **Windows Terminal** application.

#### Task 2: Validate deployment

1. On the taskbar, select the **Microsoft Edge** icon, and select the tab that displays the Azure portal.
2. On the Azure portal's **navigation** pane, select the **Resource groups** link.
3. On the **Resource groups** blade, select the **Serverless** resource group that you created previously in this lab.
4. On the **Serverless** blade, select the **funclogic**_[yourname]_ function app that you created previously in this lab.
5. On the **Function App** blade, select the **Functions** option in the **Functions** section.
6. On the **Functions** pane, select the existing **GetSettingInfo** function.
7. In the **Function** blade, select the **Code + Test** option in the **Developer** section.
8. In the function editor, select **Test/Run**.
9. In the automatically displayed pane, in the **HTTP method** drop-down list, select **GET**.
10. Select **Run** to test the function.
11. In the **HTTP response content**, review the results of the test run. The JSON content should now include the following code:

    ```json
    {
        "version": "0.2.4",
        "root": "/usr/libexec/mews_principal/",
        "device": {
            "id": "21e46d2b2b926cba031a23c6919"
        },
        "notifications": {
            "email": "joseph.price@contoso.com",
            "phone": "(425) 555-0162 x4151"
        }
    }
    ```

#### Review

In this exercise, you deployed a local function project to Azure Functions and validated that the functions work in Azure.
